\chapter{Problem Formulation and Implementation}

\lettrine{T}{he} formulation of the guidance law is presented in this chapter, including a full overview of the underlying Q-Law and the novel modifications made for solar sails. Before that, the problem is described in greater detail.

\section{Problem Definition and Assumptions}
The objective of this project is to develop a feedback guidance law for transferring between two orbits around a planet in orbit around the Sun using a solar sail spacecraft.

Stated more formally, the problem is given as:

\fbox{\begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\textwidth-2\fboxsep-2\fboxrule\relax}
        \textbf{Planetocentric Solar Sail Feedback Guidance Problem}

        Consider a spacecraft propelled by an ideal flat solar sail with sail loading \(\sigma\) and efficiency \(\eta\) in an ideal 2-body orbit around a planet with gravitaional parameter \(\mu\) (which itself orbits the Sun). Let be \(P\) the radiation pressure of incident sunlight, which comes from a known direction \(\hat{u}_i\).

        Given the instantaneous spacecraft state \(\{p, f, g, h, k, L\}\) and target orbit described by the elements \(\{\hat{p}, \hat{f}, \hat{g}, \hat{h}, \hat{k}\}\), determine an instantaneous spacecraft orientation in the LVLH frame (i.e. the sail normal \(\hat{n}\), presented in the form of steering angles \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\)) which ultimately brings the spacecraft to the target orbit.
    \end{minipage}}

The terms of this statement are elaborated in the proceeding subsections.

\subsection{Orbit and Environment}
\label{sec:orbit_environment}
The spacecraft is assumed to be orbiting a planet, possessing an instantaneous state expressed in modified equinoctial elements \{\(p, f, g, h, k, L\)\} (i.e an osculating orbit). The spacecraft is targeting an orbit described in modified equinoctial elements, as \(\{\hat{p}, \hat{f}, \hat{g}, \hat{h}, \hat{k}\}\)

The position of the spacecraft with respect to the planet is given by the vector \(\vec{r}\), and the absolute velocity of the spacecraft is given by \(\vec{v}\).


\textbf{Remark on Notation}: Mathematical notation for vectors follows the vectrix convention, as used in Ref. \cite{book:1487513}. Abstract vectorial quantities are written with the arrow above (e,g \(\vec{u}\)), and vectors expressed in a reference frame \(\vec{\mathcal{F}}\) are written in boldface (e.g. \(\boldsymbol{u}\)). Unit vectors are given a special notation, written using a hat (e.g. \(\hat{u}\)).

\textbf{Reference Frames}

Two reference frames are used in this problem, defined in Table \ref{tab:frames_3d}, based on common convention. The frame \(\mathcal{\vec{F}}_I\) has its origin at the center of the planet, and is taken to be inertial. The \(\mathcal{\vec{F}}_{\text{LVLH}}\) is attached to the spacecraft, and its orientation is defined by the position vector of the spacecraft and the plane of the orbit.

    \caption{The frames involved, and their definitions.}
    \label{tab:frames_3d}
\end{table}
Quantities related to the guidance law are expressed in the LVLH frame, including steering command outputs. This choice of frame is motivated by past formulations of the Q-Law, which are based on variational equations in the LVLH frame.

\textbf{Sun}
The Sun is located at a position \(\vec{r}_{\astrosun}\) with respect to the planet, and hence the vector going from the Sun to the spacecraft is given by \(\vec{r} - \vec{r}_{\astrosun}\). The direction of incident light is therefore given by \(\hat{u} = -\frac{\vec{r} - \vec{r}_{\astrosun}}{||\vec{r} - \vec{r}_{\astrosun}||}\).

A diagram describing the elements of the problem discussed so far is shown in Figure \ref{fig:problem_setup}.

\subsection{Spacecraft Orientation Convention}
The output of the guidance law is a spacecraft orientation in the LVLH frame. That is, the guidance law expresses the unit vector \(\hat{n}\) in terms of the output steering angles \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\).

The convention used in this project follows Refs. \cite{petropoulos2004low, vargaperez2016, sanjeev2023}, and is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:orientation_convention}.

\input{figures/problem_setup/orientation_convention}
\(\alpha\) is a clockwise steering angle from the \(y\)-axis in the \(xy\) LVLH plane, and \(\beta\) is a steering angle towards the \(+z\) axis.

That is to say, the direction vector of the spacecraft is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{n}(\alpha, \beta) = \mathcal{\vec{F}}_{\text{LVLH}}^T
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \cos \beta \sin \alpha \\
        \cos \beta \cos \alpha \\
        \sin \beta
    \end{bmatrix}
    \label{eq:alpha_beta_n}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Dynamics}
\textbf{Sail Thrust}

Dynamics for an idealized flat solar sail are presented and used in the implementation of numerical simulations.

For a solar sail pointing in the direction \(\hat{n}\) and for incident light in the direction \(\hat{u}_i\), the acceleration imparted on the sail is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \vec{F} = \frac{2 P \eta}{\sigma}(\hat{u}_i \cdot \hat{n})^2 \ \mathrm{sign}(\hat{u}_i \cdot \hat{n}) \ \hat{n}
    \ [\unit{m\ s^{-2}}] \label{eq:solar_force}
\end{equation}

Where \(P = \qty{9.12e-6}{N\ m^{-2}}\) is the value of solar radiation pressure at a distance of 1 AU. The quantity \(\sigma = \frac{m}{A}\) [\unit{kg\ m^{-2}}] referred to as \textit{sail loading} is the mass of the spacecraft divided by the sail area, and is conventionally used to parameterize sail performance. A dimensionless efficiency factor \(\eta\) represents ``how reflective'' the material of the sail is, relative to a perfect reflector. The leading coefficient of 2 results from force imparted both by incident and reflected photons (see Figure \ref{fig:perfect_sail}.)

\textbf{Variational Equations of Motion}

The equations of motion of the spacecraft in modified equinoctial orbital elements are given by (\ref{eq:equinoctial_eom_3d}) below.
\begin{equation}
    \diff{}{t}
    {
        \renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.2}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            p \\f\\g\\h\\k\\L
        \end{bmatrix}}
    =
    \frac{1}{q}\sqrt{\frac{p}{\mu}}
    {
        \renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.2}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            0        & 2p               & 0                                 \\
            q\sin L  & (q+1) \cos L + f & -g(h \sin L - k \cos L)           \\
            -q\cos L & (q+1) \sin L + g & f(h \sin L - k \cos L)            \\
            0        & 0                & \tfrac{\cos L}{2} (1 + h^2 + k^2) \\
            0        & 0                & \tfrac{\sin L}{2} (1 + h^2 + k^2) \\
            0        & 0                & h \sin L - k \cos L
        \end{bmatrix}}
    {\begin{bmatrix}
            F_r      \\
            F_\theta \\
            F_n
        \end{bmatrix}}
    +
    {
    \renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.2}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 \\0\\0\\0\\0\\
        \frac{q^2 \sqrt{\mu p}}{p^2}
    \end{bmatrix}} \label{eq:equinoctial_eom_3d}
\end{equation}
\begin{align*}
    \text{with} \ \ q & \equiv 1 + f\cos L + g\sin L
    \intertext{\(F_r\), \(F_\theta\), \(F_n\) correspond to perturbing accelerations on the spacecraft expressed in the LVLH frame corresponding to the radial, tangential, and normal directions respectively. That is:}
    \vec{F}           & =
    \mathcal{\vec{F}}_{\mathrm{LVLH}}^T
    \begin{bmatrix}
        F_r \\F_\theta\\F_n
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}





\subsection{Motion of the Sun}
The sun is assumed to be \qty{1.5e8}{m} from the center of the coordinate system, at an angle varying by \(2\pi\) in 1 year (\(\tau = \qty{365.25}{d} = \qty{31557600}{s}\)).

That is,
\begin{equation}
    \vec{r}_{\astrosun}(t) =
    \num{1.5e8}
    \
    \mathcal{\vec{F}}_I^T
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \cos(\lambda_{\astrosun})                   \\
        \sin(\lambda_{\astrosun}) \cos(\varepsilon) \\
        \sin(\lambda_{\astrosun}) \sin(\varepsilon)
    \end{bmatrix}
    \unit{m}
    \label{eq:sun_position_3d}
\end{equation}
Where \(\lambda_{\astrosun} = \frac{2 \pi}{\tau} t\), with \(t=0\) corresponding to the vernal equinox, and \(\varepsilon = \ang{23.439}\) is the obliquity of the ecliptic.

This is obviously not reflective of Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun, but it is assumed to be adequate as a starting point.

In this analysis, the position of the Sun is considered to be \textbf{quasi-static}, that is, \(\dot{\lambda}_{\astrosun} = 0\), since the motion of the Sun occurs on a timescale much longer than the period of an orbit.

\section{Methodology}
The guidance law is implemented in a two-stage architecture, depicted in Figure \ref{fig:algorithm_diagram} below. This choice is discussed more in proceeding sections.

The guidance law occupies the left half of the diagram (blocks in blue and green), while the rest of the dynamics are shown in the purple blocks on the right.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/compute_topology.drawio.pdf}
    \caption{Architecture of the guidance law, along with the dynamics of the spacecraft.}
    \label{fig:algorithm_diagram}
\end{figure}

The key idea of the overall approach taken in this project is to separate solar sail-related considerations (direction of incident light, restrictions on orientation) as much as possible from the Q-Law. The Q-Law stage of the guidance law \textbf{treats the solar sail as if it were a conventional low-thrust spacecraft} capable of producing an acceleration \(F_{\max}\) in \textbf{all directions}. From this, it generates idealized angles \(\alpha^*, \beta^*\), which are then adapted by the second stage to make them feasible for a solar sail.

Rather than try to rework the Q-Law with solar sail dynamics like Ref. \cite{oguri2023solar}, this approach sticks with the conventional low-thrust guidance origins of the Q-Law; the cone angle adaptation block can be thought of as being \textbf{part of the dynamics}, with the Q-Law operating as if it were controlling a regular low-thrust spacecraft of acceleration  \(F_{\max}\).

\section{Formulation of Simplified Q-Law}
The simplified Q-Law is derived in this section, along with a computational procedure for assembling the steering angle outputs.

\subsection{Control-Lyapunov Function}
The simplified Q-Law is structured very similarly to previous works (Refs. \cite{petropoulos2004low, vargaperez2016, sanjeev2023}), following a control-Lyapunov function \(Q\), which is then differentiated in terms of steering angles \(\alpha, \beta\) to determine the thrust direction maximizing \(-\dot{Q}\).

The control-Lyapunov function is given below in Equation \ref{eq:Q_func}.
\begin{align}
    Q        & = (1+W_P P) \sum_{\moe} W_{\moe} S_{\moe} \left(\frac{\moe - \hat{\moe}}{\dot{\moe}_{\maxrocall}} \right)^2 \ \, \moe \in \{p, f, g, h, k\} \label{eq:Q_func} \\
    S_{\moe} & = \begin{cases}
                     \frac{1}{R_e} & \moe = p         \\
                     1             & \text{Otherwise} \\
                 \end{cases} \nonumber                                                                                                                            \\
    P        & = \exp\left[\gamma \left( 1 - \frac{r_p}{r_{p, \text{min}}} \right) \right] \nonumber                                                                         \\
    a        & = \frac{p}{1-e^2} \nonumber                                                                                                                                   \\
    r_{p}    & = a (1-e) = p\frac{(1-e)}{(1+e)(1-e)} = \frac{p}{1+\sqrt{f^2 + g^2}} \nonumber
\end{align}
with \(\dot{\moe}_{\maxrocall}\) being taken to mean the maximum achieveable rate of change in that orbital element for any value of steering angles \((\alpha, \beta)\) and true longitude \(L\).

The only variables in \(Q\) are \(\moe \in \{p, f, g, h, k\}\), and therefore \(Q\) can be written as a sum of derivatives using the chain rule:
\begin{align*}
    \dot{Q} & = \sum_{\moe} \diffp{Q}{{\moe}} \dot{\moe}
\end{align*}
Note that Equation \ref{eq:equinoctial_eom_3d} in fact gives \(\dot{\moe}\) as a function of \(F_r, F_\theta, F_n\). The idea then is to link \(\dot{Q}\) to the thrust model for the solar sail, without being overly specific. The key decision taken in deriving the Q-Law portion of the guidance law is to \textbf{assume that the solar sail always produces its maximum possible thrust in any direction} (i.e. Figure \ref{fig:thrust_curve}). Hence, Equation \ref{eq:max_accel_assumption} is taken to be true (rather than Equation \ref{eq:solar_force}) for deriving ideal steering angles.
\begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        F_r      \\
        F_\theta \\
        F_n
    \end{bmatrix} =
    \frac{2P\eta}{\sigma}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \cos \beta \sin \alpha \\
        \cos \beta \cos \alpha \\
        \sin \beta
    \end{bmatrix}
    \equiv
    F_{\max}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \cos \beta \sin \alpha \\
        \cos \beta \cos \alpha \\
        \sin \beta
    \end{bmatrix}
    \label{eq:max_accel_assumption}
\end{equation}
Keeping the relationship simple using only \(F_{\max}\) allows for a very general application of the guidance law to a broad range of spacecraft configurations.

\subsection{Ideal Steering Angles}
By simultaneously considering Equations \ref{eq:equinoctial_eom_3d} and \ref{eq:max_accel_assumption}, \(\dot{\moe}\) becomes a function of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\).

\(\dot{Q}\) can therefore be expressed in a form based on steering angles, shown below:
\begin{align}
    \dot{Q}  & = D_1 \cos \beta \sin \alpha + D_2 \cos \beta \cos \alpha + D_3 \sin \beta \label{eq:q_dot_angles_form} \\
    \intertext{For some \(D_1\), \(D_2\), \(D_3\) based on other variables/parameters. Finding the stationary point of \(\dot{Q}\) with respect to \((\alpha, \beta)\) gives:}
    \alpha^* & = \mathrm{atan2}\left(-D_1, -D_2\right) \label{eq:alpha_star}                                           \\
    \beta^*  & = \mathrm{atan2}\left(-D_3, \sqrt{D_1^2 + D_2^2}\right) \label{eq:beta_star}
\end{align}
which maximizes \(-\dot{Q}\). This form is obtained from Ref. \cite{vargaperez2016}, where the definition of \(D_1\) and \(D_2\) are swapped compared to this project. The reasoning behind the ordering here is such that \(D_1, D_2, D_3\) line up with \(F_r, F_\theta, F_n\).

\subsection{Assembling the Guidance Output}
The remaining piece consists of deriving expressions for all of the terms in \(Q\) and \(\dot{Q}\) and assembling them to produce optimal steering angles.

\textbf{Expressions for \(\dot{\moe}_{\maxrocall}\)}

\(\dot{f}_{\maxrocall}\) and \(\dot{g}_{\maxrocall}\) are taken as approximate analytical forms, first developed by Ref. \cite{vargaperez2016}. The other 3 orbital elements have exact analytical expressions for maximum rate of change, obtained by manipulating Equation \ref{eq:equinoctial_eom_3d}.
\begin{align*}
    \dot{p}_{\maxrocall} & = \frac{2p}{q} \sqrt{\frac{p}{\mu}} F_{\max}                                   \\
    \dot{f}_{\maxrocall} & \approx 2F_{\max} \sqrt{\frac{p}{\mu}}                                       &
    \dot{g}_{\maxrocall} & \approx 2F_{\max} \sqrt{\frac{p}{\mu}}                                         \\
    \dot{h}_{\maxrocall} & = \tfrac{1}{2}F_{\max} \sqrt{\frac{p}{\mu}} \frac{1+h^2+k^2}{\sqrt{1-g^2}+f} &
    \dot{k}_{\maxrocall} & = \tfrac{1}{2}F_{\max} \sqrt{\frac{p}{\mu}}\frac{1+h^2+k^2}{\sqrt{1-f^2}+g}
\end{align*}

\textbf{Partials of \(Q\)}

Each partial derivative of \(Q\) can be written as:
\begin{equation*}
    \diffp{Q}{{\moe}} = W_{\moe} S_{\moe} \left[ W_P\diffp{P}{{\moe}}\left(\frac{\moe - \hat{\moe}}{\dot{\moe}_{\maxrocall}} \right)^2 + 2 (1+W_P P) \left(\frac{\moe - \hat{\moe}}{\dot{\moe}_{\maxrocall}} \right) \right] \ \, \moe \in \{p, f, g, h, k\}
\end{equation*}
The final forms of \(D_1, D_2, D_3\) can now be computed from this, with a few shorthands introduced for convenience:
\begin{align*}
    \boldsymbol{\Xi}_E & = \begin{bmatrix}
                               2  \left(\frac{\moe - \hat{\moe}}{\dot{\moe}_{\maxrocall}} \right)
                           \end{bmatrix}_{\moe \in \{p, f, g, h, k\}} \in \mathbb{R}^5                                                 \\
    \boldsymbol{\Xi}_P & = \begin{bmatrix}
                               \diffp{P}{{\moe}}\left(\frac{\moe - \hat{\moe}}{\dot{\moe}_{\maxrocall}} \right)^2
                           \end{bmatrix}_{\moe \in \{p, f, g, h, k\}} \in \mathbb{R}^5 \\

\end{align*}
Combining everything together gives:
\begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol{D} = \begin{bmatrix}

\end{equation}

Combined with Equations \ref{eq:alpha_star} and \ref{eq:beta_star}, this gives a computational procedure for the ideal steering angles.

Additionally, \(\diffp{P}{{\moe}}\) is calculated using symbolic algebra, with expressions shown below. They are rather ugly, but presented for completeness.
\begin{align*}
    \diffp{P}{p} & = -\frac{k}{r_{p, \min } \,{\left(\sqrt{f^2 +g^2 }+1\right)}}\exp\left[-k\,{\left(\frac{p}{r_{p, \min } \,{\left(\sqrt{f^2 +g^2 }+1\right)}}-1\right)}\right]                         \\

\section{The Simplified Q-Law Alone is Insufficient}
\label{sec:insufficient}
A solar-sail-agnostic formulation of the Q-Law is insufficient as a solar sail guidance law on its own. There are two notable problem cases which arise from ignoring solar sail attitude constraints:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item The Q-Law can request a thrust direction which points \textit{towards} the Sun, resulting in reverse thrust. This causes the guidance solution to become unstable.
    \item The Q-Law can request a thrust direction which points almost perpendicular to the direction of incident light, which, following Equation \ref{eq:solar_force} produces nearly no thrust and stalls the progress of the solar sail.
\end{enumerate}

These are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:degencases}.

Ignoring solar sail dynamics in the Q-Law portion of the guidance law simplifies the formulation, but comes at the cost of requiring an additional mechanism to overcome the above issues. The solution used in this project is to transform the desired thrust direction \(\hat{n}^*\) into an ``actual'' thrust direction \(\hat{n}\) by examining the cone angle associated with \(\hat{n}^*\), and comparing it with what is achievable by the solar sail.

\section{Cone Angle Adaptation Heuristic}
The heuristic used to adapt the ideal steering angles from the simplified Q-Law stage is formulated in this section, beginning from the conceptual motivation of the idea.

\subsection{Concept}
If the cone angle produced by the ideal steering angles from the first stage is outside the achievable range of the solar sail, there are two options:
\begin{enumerate}
    \setlength{\parskip}{2pt}
    \item \textbf{Feather the sail}: Orient the solar sail (normal) at exactly \ang{90} relative to the incident sunlight to produce zero thrust.
    \item \textbf{Make a compromise}: Find the ``closest'' valid sail orientation, subject to the cone angle restriction. (This notion of ``closeness'' is elaborated upon in the formulation).
\end{enumerate}

Feathering the sail is useful for situations where the cone angle suggested by the first stage exceeds \ang{90} (i.e. the sail cannot produce thrust in that direction). This prevents the spacecraft from regressing \textbf{away} from its target orbit.

The latter option is particularly helpful even in the case of an ideal flat solar sail, where the first stage of the guidance law could produce a set of steering angles resulting in a cone angle very close to \ang{90}. The thrust produced in such a situation would be extremely small, and result in less progress being made compared to if the guidance law accepted a thrust direction which does not point exactly towards the local optimum. By accepting a non-ideal direction, the spacecraft can still make progress towards its goal.

This highlights a counter-intuitive aspect of solar sail dynamics; it is sometimes favourable to point somewhere other than the desired direction of thrust, so that a greater amount of total thrust (not necessarily in the desired direction) is produced. \textbf{Decreasing the cone angle of the sail can dramatically increase its thrust}, and this is the core idea of the cone angle adaptation heuristic.

\subsection{Formulation}
The ideal steering angles \(\alpha^*, \beta^*\) are used to compute an idealized cone angle.
\begin{equation}
    \varphi^* = \arccos(\hat{u}_i \cdot \hat{n}^*)
    \label{eq:cone_star}
\end{equation}
where \(\hat{n}^* = \hat{n}(\alpha^*, \beta^*)\) can be computed using (\ref{eq:alpha_beta_n}) and \(\hat{u} = -\frac{\vec{r} - \vec{r}_{\astrosun}}{||\vec{r} - \vec{r}_{\astrosun}||}\). Both vectors are expressed in the same frame for computational procedures (e.g. the LVLH frame).

Consider an angle \(\kappa \in [\ang{0}\, \ang{90}]\) which is a guidance law parameter defining a cone in space called the \textit{thrust cone}. The thrust cone has its axis coincident with \(\hat{u}_i\), and is set such that any thrust direction laying within the cone produces a ``large'' amount of thrust.

Let the \textit{limit plane} be the plane normal to \(\hat{u}^i\). Consider a vector \(\hat{b}\) which lies in the limit plane, e.g. \(\hat{b} = \hat{u}_i \times (\hat{n}^* \times \hat{u}_i)\).

The resulting sail normal \(\hat{n}\) is then calculated as:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{n} = \begin{cases}
        \hat{n}^*                                       & \cos \varphi^* > \cos \kappa          \\
        \cos \kappa \ \hat{u}_i + \sin \kappa \ \hat{b} & \cos \varphi^* \in  [ 0, \cos \kappa] \\
        \hat{b}                                         & \cos \varphi^* < 0
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:ndf_law}
\end{equation}
Or, in words:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the desired thrust direction lies within the thrust cone, use it as-is.
    \item If the desired thrust direction points away from the Sun but lies outside the thrust cone, project it upon the thrust cone, and use the resultant direction.
    \item If the desired thrust direction points towards the Sun, feather the sail.
\end{itemize}
This is illustrated more clearly in Figure \ref{fig:steering_heuristic_overview}.

\input{figures/problem_setup/steering_overview}
Figure \ref{fig:steering_heuristic_cases} provides a visual depiction of all 3 cases.

\input{figures/problem_setup/steering_cases}

Both of the problematic cases from Section \ref{sec:insufficient} are addressed with this adaptation heuristic. \textbf{This approach takes care of two birds with one cone.}

Setting the thrust cone angle \(\kappa\) is a matter of guidance strategy; as a starting point, it could be set to be equal to the absolute maximum allowable cone angle for a solar sail (e.g. \ang{60} for a realistic solar sail), but it can also be set to an even lower angle to enforce greater production of thrust. This parameter is therefore decoupled from the solar sail thrust model used, and could readily be extended to a variety of spacecraft configurations.

\section{Combined Guidance Law}
The Q-Law and the cone angle adaptation heuristic form a combined guidance law. This guidance law is called \boxed{\text{QUAIL: Q-Law Using Angle of Incidence Limits}}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/quail_logo_v2.pdf}
    \caption{QUAIL logo.}
    \label{fig:quail_logo}
\end{figure}

Following the computation of \((\alpha^*, \beta^*)\) by the first stage, \(\varphi^*\) is computed using Equation \ref{eq:cone_star}. \(\hat{n}^*\) is computed in referential form (i.e. its components are calculated relative to some reference frame), and the vector \(\hat{b}\) is formed. Then, Equation \ref{eq:ndf_law} is used to calculate \(\hat{n}\), using conditional expressions.

Expressing \(\hat{n}\) in \(\vec{\mathcal{F}}_{\text{LVLH}}\), the steering angles \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) can be found by working backwards from Equation \ref{eq:alpha_beta_n}. A reference formulation is given below:
\begin{align*}
    \alpha & = \mathrm{atan2}\left(\hat{n} \cdot \hat{x}_{\text{LVLH}}, \ \hat{n} \cdot \hat{y}_{\text{LVLH}}\right)                                                      \\
    \beta  & = \mathrm{atan2}\left(\hat{n} \cdot \hat{z}_{\text{LVLH}}, \ \sqrt{(\hat{n} \cdot \hat{x}_{\text{LVLH}})^2 + (\hat{n} \cdot \hat{y}_{\text{LVLH}})^2}\right)
\end{align*}

The problem statement at the beginning of this chapter is therefore solved by QUAIL.
