\chapter{Significance and Future Work}

\lettrine{A}{n} overview of the developed guidance law is presented, and potential areas for future work are identified.


\section{Importance of Guidance Law}

\subsection{As a Product}
A solar sailing guidance law for planetocentric maneuvering was developed, proving to be successful in a limited run of orbital transfer cases. Several issues remain, but the novel approach taken shows great promise for applicability to other areas, and the guidance law is easy to modify for further improvements.

\subsection{As an Approach}
Cone angle adaptation



\section{Future Work}


\textbf{Incorporation of Attitude Dynamics}

On the simulator side,

\textbf{Cone Angle Adaptation Heuristic Rework}

The current approach for cone angle adaptation is simple and functional, but lacks a solid mathematical justification in its design. Designing an adaptation scheme which is based on some form of mathematical optimality is desirable from a point of analysis, and may lead to better performance.

Coverstone \cite{coverstone2003technique} presents a feedback guidance law which maximizes the amount of thrust generated by a solar sail towards a given direction. Oguri \cite{oguri2023solar} makes use of a similar approach. The idea is to find some \(\hat{n} = \hat{n}^\dagger\) such that the product \(\vec{F}(\hat{n}) \cdot \hat{n}^*\) (i.e. the projection of the resultant acceleration upon the ideal steering direction) is maximized. This can yield an orientation which is neither exactly on the ``projection cone'' nor directly facing towards \(\hat{n}^*\), but which actually maximizes the ``amount of progress'' made towards the ideal direction.



\subsection{Applications to New Dynamics}
The current dynamics model is very simple. Demonstration of robustness to plant model variation would be a very attractive attribute for the guidance law.

\textbf{Other Bodies}

Only Earth-centric orbits have been considered so far. With increasing interest in cislunar space, it may be useful to investigate the applicablity of solar sails for translunar trajectories.

There are also mission using solar sails to the inner solar system, such as a Mercury sample return mission proposed by Hughes \cite{hughes2006sample}. Although the guidance law developed in this project is targeted at planetocentric orbits, it may also work for heliocentric trajectories.

\textbf{Sail Thrust Models}

So far, only a flat idealized sail has been considered. Ref. \cite{oguri2023solar} uses a more sophisticated thrust model incorporated into the Q-Law. It would be interesting to see how the guidance law produced in this project compares against Oguri's.

\textbf{Non-Keplerian Orbits}

Solar sails are a prime candidate for exploiting non-Keplerian trajectories such as halo orbits around Lagrange points; the lack of a propellant consumption leads to an uncapped mission life in a frozen orbit. Applying the guidance law to a multibody problem could give interesting results, but is made difficult by the lack of orbital elements to describe such trajectories.

\textbf{As a Starting Point for Global Methods}

The trajectories produced by the guidance law could be used as an initial guess for global methods to kickstart their optimization processes.
